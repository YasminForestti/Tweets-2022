# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

This project aims to develop a solution for the Kaggle "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets" competition, available at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started.

## Objective
The main objective is to create an effective classification model to predict whether a tweet is related to real disasters or not.
Two approaches were explored to achieve this goal: one using logistic regression and the other employing LSTM neural networks.

## Project structure
The project is organized as follows:

  -**Data:** Contains the training and test data sets provided by the competition and the processed data. 
  
  -**Study Test:** Contains study notebooks
